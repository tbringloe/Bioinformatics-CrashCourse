## Objective
The repository provides a basic introduction to bioinformatics intended for upper level undergraduate students. The content covers read quality control, assembly of short reads, read mapping, and similarity searches of DNA barcodes against NCBI (BLAST searches) and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD). The content required to complete the project and lab assignments detailed here are not provided in their entirety due to data storage limitations on github. However, you may request missing content via email.
